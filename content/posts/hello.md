I’ve wanted to build my own website since I was young.
I’ve always been full of imagination and eager to explore new ideas.
I needed a space — a little paradise — where I could record my thoughts, whether through writing, images, or videos.
Thanks to technology, this dream is finally possible. It feels like a gift to my inner child.
